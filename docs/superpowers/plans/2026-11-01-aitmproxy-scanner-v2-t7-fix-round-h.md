# T7 fix round H: residuals from the combined re-review of fix rounds G-A, G-B and G-C

**Plan:** `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-31-aitmproxy-scanner-v2-t7-tui-plan.md` (Review log rows marked "fix round H").
**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-31-aitmproxy-scanner-v2-tui-scan-surface-design.md` as amended through 2026-11-01.
**When:** after the three re-reviews of G-C and the three of G-A+G-B have reported; one Coder for the cell items, one for the Rust items if any; then Task 16.

## Cell (`tests/e2e/tui/test_tui_scan_live.py`)

H1. A cleanup step that raises skips the work-dir removal (`run`'s `finally`): wrap each cleanup statement in its own `try/except Exception: pass` (or nest `try/finally` so `rmtree(work)` is the innermost), and run `l4_remove_quietly` before `term.stop()` so a hung TUI kill cannot keep the scope entry alive.

H2. An `l4.scope.add` whose reply is lost (a `BusError` while reading the reply, not a `ToolError`) leaves the entry on a runner core: on `BusError` only, list the scope and remove an entry whose full tuple equals the one just sent (`cidr`, `ports`, `interface`, `direction`, `capability`, runtime source); an exact-tuple match of the cell's own values is not the loose match G97 ruled out.

H3. The inspector failure screen is tagged `inspector` even when the inspector did not open (`step_t7_17`, `step_t7_19`): `ctx.screen(step, 'inspector' if opened else 'scan')`.

## Not in this round

The harness's shared default operator token on a loopback bus and the parent env inherited by the TUI child are pre-existing harness conventions (T10).
